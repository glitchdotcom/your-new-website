# Your new website!

> ⚠️ **Glitch project hosting shuts down on 8th July 2025 so you won't be able to remix this project anymore – you are welcome to use the source code if you'd like to deploy it somewhere else!**

This is a website you can remix to make your own. Open the __Preview__ pane at the bottom of the Glitch editor to see your changes appear live. On the left you'll find the files that make up your site, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can upload images in __Assets__. Go ahead and edit your remix! 🪄

## Point a domain at your site 🌎

Your website will have a `glitch.me` address you can share with anyone – grab it in the preview, by clicking the three little dots and choosing __Copy Link__.

You can also point a domain you own at your Glitch website using Fastly:

<ul>
<li>Get your Glitch website ready to publish 🎏</li>
<li>Get yourself a domain – <a href="https://domainr.com/" target="_blank">Domainr</a> is a great place to find one 🪧</li>
<li>Use free TLS from Fastly to <a href="https://dev.to/fastly/point-a-domain-at-your-site-with-fastly-1khm" target="_blank">point the domain at your site!</a> 🚀</li>
</ul>

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads.

← `package.json`: NPM packages your website uses during development.

← `vite.config.js`: Your site uses Vite to build and serve it to users.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
